                        Surafel Mulugeta Techane, affectionately known as Sasu, was born in Seattle on May 11, 1998, 
                        to Abebech Mulugeta and Zebene Techane. From birth, Sasu was an energetic and bright star 
                        at home, school, and everywhere he went.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Early Years & Education</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sasu attended St. Joseph School on Capitol Hill for K-8, where as an 8th grader, he earned 
                        a featured role in the Passion Play at Easter—among the first hints of his innate musical talent. 
                        He moved on to Seattle Preparatory School for high school, where he was involved in student 
                        government (all 4 years), varsity tennis, theater, mock trial, and community service, traveling 
                        to New Orleans to help build housing for Hurricane Katrina victims. He graduated with honors in 2016.
                    </p>

                    <h3>New York University</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sasu was accepted to New York University's Stern School of Business with a prestigious MLK 
                        Scholarship for his high academic achievement. He studied abroad in Florence his sophomore year 
                        and quickly picked up conversational Italian. He completed his Bachelor of Science degree in 2020, 
                        concentrating in Data Science and Information Systems with a minor in Music.
                    </p>

                    <h3>A Life of Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        After graduating, Sasu worked at BNP Paribas in New York as a financial analyst, passing the 
                        grueling Series 7, SIE, and Series 63 exams. By day, he appeared to be a traditional junior banker, 
                        but Sasu remained dedicated to his entrepreneurial and creative pursuits. He moved back to Seattle 
                        to continue developing TeffBar and honing his singing and piano talents, producing and recording 
                        song snippets for family and friends.
                    </p>

                    <p class="closing-text">
                        Surafel is described by all who knew him as a brilliant, funny, and loving person. His energy 
                        was infectious and he radiated positivity. His untimely passing leaves every room he graced a 
                        little bit dimmer, and he will be deeply missed and remembered forever.

                    <h3>A Bridge Between Cultures</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, while still a student at NYU, Surafel launched The Teff Lab, a business selling 
                        Teff Bars—the first health food bar to feature the nutrient-rich grain teff from his family's 
                        home country of Ethiopia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sasu was instilled at an early age by his parents to be passionate about his culture and heritage. 
                        He aimed to build sustainable partnerships between Ethiopian teff farmers and the global market 
                        through his work with TeffBar. He believed deeply in the power of ethical commerce and its ability 
                        to improve the lives of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sasu was committed to ensuring teff farmers received fair compensation for their work. His dedication 
                        to building bridges between traditional Ethiopian agriculture and modern health food markets created 
                        new opportunities for Ethiopian teff farmers, while sharing the nutritional benefits of teff with the world.
